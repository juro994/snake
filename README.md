# Snake
This is a simple implementation of a well-known old snake game in pure html/css/js.

This was programmed in one evening, just as a simple javascript exercise for me to familiarize myself with javascript specific aspects like closures, lexical enviroments, scope chain, this object etc.

In order for this to be an actual enjoyable game, it still needs some work :)
